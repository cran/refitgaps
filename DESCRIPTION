Description: If a teacher was assigned, say, hours 1, 2, 4, 6 for his lessons
    on the current day, then he got two "gaps" (or "holes"), in hours 3 and 5.
    If the total number of holes in the existing daily schedule is too large
    (exceeding, say, 6% of the total lessons), then the problem arises of
    reallocating the respective lessons by hours (respecting the constraints
    induced by the existence of coupled lessons) so that 
    the total number of holes is as small as possible.
